    <p>Attacking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aim with mouse and hold left mouse button for a bit to charge up spell, once the white indicator at your mouse position is gone, it will display a guide of where the attack will happen and then let go to execute spell.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>(With the quick inventory closed)</p>
    <span>Spell Menu:</span>

    <p>Aiming / Locking on (Needs to be more intuitive in the future)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Simply right clicking to lock on is the fastest way but you can't choose which hitbox, so if there was a weak point on the enemy use the "Q" method to specifically lock on to the head for example.</i></li>
      <li>(without holding "Q") RIGHT CLICK to select the first available hitbox on an enemy. RIGHT CLICK again to deselect.</li>
      <li>Hold "Q" to display the available targets that you can lock on to. (Targets will only appear if in a certain range of your mouse pointer)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>*Targets are displayed at the center of hitboxes*</li>
      </ul>
      <li>While a target is displayed, LEFT CLICK on it to select it. Right click without holding "Q" to deselect.</li>
    </ul>
