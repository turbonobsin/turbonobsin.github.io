    <p><i>*This weapon is not fully completed*</i></p>

    <p>Differences from Pistol</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The normal shooting speed is much slower</li>
      <li>You can't move while shooting</li>
      <li>Damage per bullet is greater but slower speed, more important to hit the target everytime with this weapon to maximize damage.</li>
      <li>Pushed backward slightly from the shot (Planned but not implimented)</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Attacking: (same as pistol)</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Hold left mouse button to shoot with normal attack, does not take energy.</i></li>
      <li>Hold "Shift" while shooting for a 2x faster shot that takes 1 energy per shot.</li>
      <li>Hold "C" while shooting for a 4x faster shot and 2x faster bullet that takes 4 energy per shot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aiming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aiming is unfinished with this weapon and it acts the same way as every other weapon.</li>
      <li>As of this time, the bullet does not go to where the target is.</li>
    </ul>
