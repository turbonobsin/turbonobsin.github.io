    <h3>Hoe</h3>
    <br>
    <p><i>The purpose of this tool is to till dirt in rows in order to plant crops.</i></p>
    <p><i>Same controls as Hoe and Tamper</i><br>Hold right click and let go on whatever position you want it at to create a starting point.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From any piece of tilled dirt, hover over it until a white indicator pixels shows</li>
      <li>Hold down the left mouse button, and move the player in the direction you want to extend the row</li>
      <li>Don't move the mouse while extending the row unless you know what you are doing because it could be confusing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Tilled dirt is a lighter brown and dug dirt is a darker brown.</i></p>
