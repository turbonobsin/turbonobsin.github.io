    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Day/Night Cycle</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The equivelent of 1 day or 24 hours in game, from morning to morning, is 9.17 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Chunks</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As you move off the edge of the screen a new chunk is generated virtually making the world infinite.</li>
      <p>Biomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Currently only the Plains and Forest biomes exist in the Web Version.</li>
        <li>In the PC Version, the world is an ocean full of continents with different biomes.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Rain</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rain can occur at random times</li>
      <li>After 10 to 20 seconds of rain there is a chance that the rain will get heavier and pour or get lighter and barely rain at all.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fireflies</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fireflies only show up during the night, more show up in the darkest time of night, and less show up during rain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shadows</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shadows appear below most things that are elevated off the ground so you can see how high up they are.</li>
      <li>Shadows use collision physics per pixel to be drawn on the closest surface below you. (Jump over the stairs area in the PHYSICS PLAYGROUND for an example)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Decor</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The farm to the right of the house will be functional in the future but not yet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>PHYSICS PLAYGROUND</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is one of the oldest things in the whole game.</li>
      <p>Moving platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The moving platform will push you away as it moves (this may seem like duh but writing a working, intuitive collision physics system from scratch is the most difficult, advanced, and complicated thing in this entire game)</li>
        <li>When you jump onto the top of the platform, you will continue to move along with it and can walk on it as it you were walking on stationary ground (similar to real life and feels natural)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
