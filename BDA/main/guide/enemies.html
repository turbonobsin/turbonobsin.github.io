    <h3>Enemies</h3>

    <p>Hitboxes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enemies can have 1 or more hitboxes.</li>
      <li>Holding "Q" will show lock on targets which are displayed at the center of each hitbox.</li>
      <li>Some hitboxes are weaker and take more damage than other parts.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Weakness</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some enemies are weak to certain elements, such as machines are weak to lightning, and mammals are weak to fire.</li>
      <li>When damage with an element type is delt to an enemy, if that enemy is weak to that element the damage is multiplied by a certain value.</li>
      <li>Damage amplified by weakness appears as a <span style="color:dodgerblue">blue number</span> instead of white</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Resistance</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resistance is the opposite of weakness, damage is decreased by a certain amount if the enemy is resistant to that element.</li>
      <li>Damage reduced by resistance will appear as a <span style="color:orange">light orange, yellow</span> number instead of white</li>
      <li><i>*Resistance has not been implimented yet*</i></li>
    </ul>
