    <h3>The System</h3>

    <p>The entire game is made with my custom, fully built from scratch graphics system and engine called the "Nobsin Engine" that handles drawing each and every pixel on the screen, image effects, image loading, draw pixelated text, and animation systems. Although the true power comes not from drawing high resolution images, but by drawing many many individual particles and complex visual effects by having full power over the manupulation of screen pixels like the vortex spell pinching in the screen.</p>
    <p>The entire physics and collision system is also made fully by me from scratch.</p>
    <p>Each particle from rain or breaking objects, fireflies, bullets, or any particle effects are handled individually per pixel thanks to the magic behind my graphics engine which has drawing speeds by on average 20x faster than default built-in drawing and is able to handle this.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The PC Version also runs using the Nobsin Engine but it is rewritten to match the different programming language and isn't fully complete. The performance of the PC Version of the Nobsin Engine can reach around 10 times faster than the web Nobsin Engine! Making it around 200 times faster than the built-in web drawing library!</p>
