    <p>Attacking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Hold left mouse button to shoot with normal attack, does not take energy.</i></li>
      <li>Hold "Shift" while shooting for a 2x faster shot that takes 1 energy per shot.</li>
      <li>Hold "C" while shooting for a 4x faster shot and 2x faster bullet that takes 4 energy per shot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aiming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Simply right clicking to lock on is the fastest way but you can't choose which hitbox, so if there was a weak point on the enemy use the "Q" method to specifically lock on to the head for example.</i></li>
      <li><i>Upon normal attack, it will aim at selected hitbox.</i></li>
      <li>(without "Q" held) RIGHT CLICK on an enemy to automatically lock on the first hitbox on the enemy. Right click again to deselect.</li>
      <li>Holding "Q" will show available hitboxes in range and you can click with LEFT mouse button to select or click anywhere else to deselect the hitbox.</li>
      <li>Holding "Q" and RIGHT CLICK, it will show available hitboxes in range, ones hovered over will turn red, and when mouse let go will shoot bullets to those places.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <!--<p>Vertical Aim: (it is really annoying because the page scrolls up and down and you change the aim of the weapon. (this feature was added before the settings below the game existed)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lets you aim up or down.</li>
      <li>TO RESET, CLICK MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON (3 finger click on touchpad)</li>
    </ul>-->
