    <p>Attacking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Normal Attack</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keybind: "D"</li>
          <li>This is a normal slash in front of you that does not take energy.</li>
          <li>Holding "D" or pressing "D" right after a move is over will take it to the next move in the sequence. If you wait too long the cycle starts over.</li>
          <li>The first move is a slash down, second is a slash up, and the third is a more powerful hit that slashes from the front to back and can hit behind you.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Energy Attacks (takes EP)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can be chained with normal attacks.</li>
          <li>For example: Doing 2 swirls in a row and immidiately pressing "D" after the last will cause that normal attack to be the 3rd stronger attack in the sequence.</li><br>
          <li>Swirl: keybind "S"</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Hits all enemies around you</li>
            <li>Good for mobbing</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
